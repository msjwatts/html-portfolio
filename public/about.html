<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a Web Developer and I'm well practiced on HTML! More to come, I swear it!</p>

<p>I'm currently self learning using Udemy. I am following Dr. Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
  I plan to finish this course in 4 months, just before we wrap up 2023.
  During this time, I will fill this website with projects to showcase what I've been learning and working on.
</p>

<p>When I'm not learning to code, I like to spend my time being
  creative. I like to get creative on my iPad using Procreate and I like to draw.
   I like to cook and be scrappy in the kitchen. I love to eat!
   I also enjoy spending time in nature;
  bicycling, kayaking and other water feature activities.
